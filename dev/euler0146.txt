> ... the numbers $n^2+1$, $n^2+3$, $n^2+7$, $n^2+9$, $n^2+13$, and $n^2+27$
> are consecutive primes

Values of $n$ satisfying one or more of the following can be skipped:
 - $n$ is odd.
 - $n$ is a multiple of 3, 7, or 13.
 - $n\equiv 3,4\pmod{7}$ (as this would imply $7\mid n^2+19$)

Thus:
 - $n$ must be even.
 - $n\bmod 7$ must be 1,2,5, or 6.
 - above two conditions combined: $n\bmod 14$ must be 2,6,8, or 12 (i.e., ±2 or
   ±6)
 - $n$ _modulo_ 3 and 13 must be nonzero.

 - For all primes $p<n^2+27$ and $a\in\{1,3,7,9,13,27\}$:

    $p\nmid n^2+a$
    ↔ $n^2\nequiv -a\pmod{p}$
    ← $-a$ is not a quadratic residue _modulo_ $p$

In order to ensure the "consecutive" part, $n$ must be such that $n^2 +
{15,19,21,25}$ are not prime.  (Note that $n^2+3$ being prime means that $n^2 +
{5,11,17,23}$ are not prime.)


Square roots of $-a$ _modulo_ various $p$:
