Code to focus on improving:
 - primeIter in eulerlib.py
 - euler0023.py
 - euler0039.py
 - euler0044.py
 - euler0052.py
  - The code could stand to be more correct rather than only working because
    the answer isn't one of the possibilities it skips.
 - euler0072.py
 - euler0092.py
 - euler0095.py
 - euler0096.py
 - euler0112.py (cf. euler0113.py)
 - euler0145.c
 - euler0205.py?
 - euler0206.py
 - euler0347.py
 - euler0357.py

- Organize all of the solutions into subfolders based on problem types
- Add the MIT license to eulerlib.*? (and only eulerlib?)
- Give aliquot and totient `mode` arguments and the option to take a
  pre-computed factorization of `n` as an argument in addition to/instead of
  `n` itself
- Give primeIter a `mode` argument
- Use the new sieve algorithm in Primes.hs and eulerlib.cpp
- euler0035.py: Test whether using sieve(10**6) would be faster than sieve(1000)
