Code to focus on improving:
 - euler0023.py
 - euler0039.py
 - euler0044.py
 - euler0052.py
  - The code could stand to be more correct rather than only working because
    the answer isn't one of the possibilities it skips.
 - euler0072.py
 - euler0092.py
 - euler0093.py
 - euler0095.py

- Organize all of the solutions into subfolders based on problem types
- Add the MIT license to eulerlib.*? (and only eulerlib?)
- Give aliquot() and totient() `presieve` arguments and the option to take a
  pre-computed factorization of `n` as an argument in addition to/instead of
  `n` itself
- Give primeIter() a `presieve` argument
- Use the new sieve algorithm in Primes.hs and eulerlib.cpp
- Stop using eulerlib/oldprimes.py
- Make factor() able to work without calling sieve() beforehand?
- Write a variant of/rewrite primeIter() so that primes are yielded as soon as
  sieve() finds them rather than waiting for sieve() to finish
