r"""Crack-free Walls

    Consider the problem of building a wall out of $2\times 1$ and $3\times 1$
    bricks (horizontal√óvertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the
    gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive
    layers, i.e. never form a "running crack".

    For example, the following $9\times 3$ wall is not acceptable due to the
    running crack shown in red:

    ![](https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p215_crackfree.gif)

    There are eight ways of forming a crack-free $9\times 3$ wall, written
    $W(9,3) = 8$.

    Calculate $W(32,10)$."""
